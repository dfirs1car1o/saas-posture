# Continuous Monitoring

> **This is optional.** The core pipeline (`agent-loop run`) produces JSON, Markdown, and DOCX
> artifacts that work standalone — no visualization platform required.
>
> This guide covers two things:
> 1. **Exporting results** to a time-series store so you can track improvements over time
> 2. **OpenSearch + Dashboards** as the bundled open-source option (Apache 2.0, runs in Docker)
>
> Most organizations already have a preferred visualization platform.
> The export script outputs standard JSON — adapt the sink to feed **Splunk**, **Elastic/Kibana**,
> **Grafana**, **Power BI**, **ServiceNow**, or any GRC tool your team uses.

## The Core Idea

Every assessment run produces structured JSON in `docs/oscal-salesforce-poc/generated/<org>/<date>/`.
`export_to_opensearch.py` reads those files and writes two document types:

| Index | One doc per | What it enables |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| `sscf-runs-*` | Assessment run | Overall score trend, NIST verdict history |
| `sscf-findings-*` | Finding per run | Per-control status history, POA&M aging, remediation velocity |

Run this after every formal assessment and you get a full audit trail over time.

---

## Option A — Bring Your Own Platform

Skip Docker entirely. Just run the export script after each assessment and pipe the data to your existing tooling:

```bash
pip install -e ".[monitoring]"   # installs opensearch-py — only needed for OpenSearch sink

python scripts/export_to_opensearch.py \
  --backlog <path/to/backlog.json> \
  --sscf    <path/to/sscf_report.json> \
  --opensearch-url https://your-opensearch-or-elastic-endpoint
```

To adapt for a different sink (Splunk, InfluxDB, etc.), modify the `export()` function in
`scripts/export_to_opensearch.py` — the `_build_run_doc()` and `_build_finding_docs()` functions
produce clean dicts you can route anywhere.

---

## Option B — Bundled OpenSearch Stack (Docker)

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Compose plugin)
- `.env` file populated with platform credentials

---

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start OpenSearch + Dashboards
docker compose up -d

# 2. Wait ~60s for dashboards to be ready, then visit
open http://localhost:5601

# 3. Run an assessment (Workday dry-run, no real credentials needed)
docker compose run --rm agent \
  python scripts/workday_dry_run_demo.py --org acme-workday --env dev

# 4. Export results to OpenSearch
docker compose run --rm agent \
  python scripts/export_to_opensearch.py --auto --org acme-workday --date 2026-03-06

# 5. Refresh http://localhost:5601 — data appears in Discover
```

---

### Running a Live Assessment

```bash
# Salesforce
docker compose run --rm agent \
  agent-loop run --env dev --org cyber-coach-dev --approve-critical

# Workday (real tenant)
docker compose run --rm agent \
  agent-loop run --platform workday --env dev --org acme --approve-critical
```

Reports land in `./docs/oscal-salesforce-poc/generated/<org>/<date>/` on your host machine (volume-mounted).

---

## Exporting Results

### Auto-discover (easiest)
```bash
python scripts/export_to_opensearch.py --auto --org <org-alias> --date <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

### Explicit paths
```bash
python scripts/export_to_opensearch.py \
  --backlog docs/oscal-salesforce-poc/generated/acme-workday/2026-03-06/workday_backlog.json \
  --sscf    docs/oscal-salesforce-poc/generated/acme-workday/2026-03-06/workday_sscf_report.json \
  --nist    docs/oscal-salesforce-poc/generated/acme-workday/2026-03-06/workday_nist_review.json
```

---

## Indexes

| Index | One doc per | Key fields |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `sscf-runs-YYYY-MM` | Assessment run | org, platform, overall_score, overall_status, nist_verdict, domain scores |
| `sscf-findings-YYYY-MM` | Finding per run | control_id, domain, severity, status, owner, due_date, poam_status |

Monthly indexes keep data volumes manageable. Search across all time with `sscf-runs-*` and `sscf-findings-*`.

---

## Pre-Built Dashboards

Three dashboards are imported automatically — no manual setup required.
Full navigation guide: **[OpenSearch Dashboards →](OpenSearch-Dashboards)**

| Dashboard | URL | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| SSCF Security Posture Overview | `/app/dashboards#/view/sscf-main-dashboard` | Cross-platform governance review (both Salesforce + Workday) |
| Salesforce Security Posture | `/app/dashboards#/view/sfdc-dashboard` | Salesforce-only findings, SBS quarterly review |
| Workday Security Posture | `/app/dashboards#/view/workday-dashboard` | Workday-only findings, WSCC compliance review |

All 19 saved objects (2 index patterns, 11 visualizations, 3 saved searches, 3 dashboards) live in
`config/opensearch/dashboards.ndjson` and are imported by the `dashboard-init` service on every fresh stack start.

To re-import manually:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5601/api/saved_objects/_import?overwrite=true" \
  -H "osd-xsrf: true" \
  --form file=@config/opensearch/dashboards.ndjson
```

---

## Continuous Monitoring on a Schedule

### GitHub Actions (weekly)
Uncomment `.github/workflows/scheduled-assessment.yml` and set secrets:
- `SF_CONSUMER_KEY` / `SF_PRIVATE_KEY` (Salesforce)
- `WD_CLIENT_ID` / `WD_CLIENT_SECRET` (Workday)
- `OPENSEARCH_URL` (point at your hosted OpenSearch instance)

### Local cron
```bash
# Run every Monday at 8am
0 8 * * 1 cd /path/to/saas-sec-agents && \
  docker compose run --rm agent \
    agent-loop run --platform workday --org acme --approve-critical && \
  docker compose run --rm agent \
    python scripts/export_to_opensearch.py --auto --org acme \
    --date $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

---

## Stopping the Stack

```bash
docker compose down          # stop containers, keep data
docker compose down -v       # stop containers AND delete OpenSearch data
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `opensearch-py not installed` | `pip install opensearch-py` or rebuild agent image |
| Dashboard shows no data | Check index exists: `curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices` |
| `dashboard-init` exits with error | Dashboards not ready yet — re-run: `docker compose restart dashboard-init` |
| Port 9200 already in use | Change `ports` in compose or stop conflicting service |
| Apple Silicon (M-series) OOM | Reduce `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` to `-Xms256m -Xmx256m` in compose |
